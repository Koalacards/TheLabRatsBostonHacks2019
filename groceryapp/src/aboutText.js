        The Lab Rats are a team of sophomores from Northeastern University who wanted
        to make something practical; something we all felt would have helped make
        our transition to college easier, along with being able to currently help
        us for the rest of our years here. We thought, what contributes to our experience
        more than what we eat? We know the struggle of a broke college student trying
        to find the best deals around, and we also were frustrated with the lack
        of a single source to compare prices. That's when we decided to create
        SimpliShop, a platform which actively sweeps the web finding prices from
        a variety of Boston supermarkets and puts it all in one easy-to-navigate
        website. Simply type in the item you want, and you will be presented with
        a list of results from nearby companies so you can can find all the best deals!
