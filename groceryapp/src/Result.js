      <p>
        The Lab Rats are a team of sophomores from Northeatern University who wanted 
        to make something practical, something we all felt would have contibuted to 
        our experience. We thought, what conttibutes to experience more than what we 
        eat? We know the struggle of a broke college student trying to find where.
